# Installation

To install the package, use the following command:
``` r
devtools::install_github("davidruegamer/deepregression")
```
Note that the installation requires additional packages (see below) and their installation is currently forced by `deepregression`.

# Requirements

The requirements are given in the `DESCRIPTION`. If you load the package manually using `devtools::load_all`, make sure the following packages are availabe:

  - Matrix
  - dplyr
  - keras
  - mgcv
  - reticulate
  - tensorflow
  - tfprobability

If you set up a Python environment for the first time, install `reticulate` and run the `check_and_install` function from the `deepregression` package. This tries to install miniconda, TF 2.1, TFP 0.9 and keras 2.4.3, which seems to be the most reliable setup for `deepregression` at the moment.
